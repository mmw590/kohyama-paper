R scripts for testing effects of tree stature on seedling and sapling recruitment and survival, based on the Forest Architecture Hypothesis by [Kohyama (1993)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2261230?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). 

A work-in-progress. As I have left the institution, I am no longer working on this project. This repository is an online archive.

Some of the input data are available online via the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute Data Repository <https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/11>.
